Its a simple reminder bot thats works with Microsoft Teams,

The code is improvised from the proactive messaging and message extension samples from Microsoft Bot framework.

What works now?

1. Schedule a reminder in public channels and group chats by selecting a message and choosing 'remind me this' from action menu
2. Schedule a reminder by chatting 1:1 with the bot, with natural language,
   e.g. Remind To submit my report in 3 hours
3. As of now it only supports one time schedule
4. Supports formats 'at HH:MM' , 'in x minutes', 'in x days'
5. Schedules are backed up by agenda framework and persisted in db


TODO:
1. Recurrence
2. add capability to message channels
