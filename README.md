Its a simple reminder bot thats works with Microsoft Teams,

The code is improvised from the proactive messaging and message extension samples from Microsoft Bot framework.

What works now?

1. Schedule a reminder in public channels and group chats by selecting a message and choosing 'remind me this' from action menu
2. Schedule a reminder by chatting 1:1 with the bot, with natural language,
   e.g. Remind To submit my report in 3 hours
3. As of now it only supports one time schedule
4. Only supports hours or minutes , not days not hours and minutes together
5. Schedules will be lost on restart


TODO:
1. Using a proper scheduling framework like agenda backed by mongo
2. Recurrence
